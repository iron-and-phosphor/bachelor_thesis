\section{Research questions}

The goal for this project is to create a maintainable and extendable front-end and type checker that future developers can continue with. The following research question could be formed of this goal. 
	How to develop a maintainable and extendable front-end and type-checker for the MC mark 3 programming language?
In order to answer the main question the following sub question were formed.
	What properties does MC have that the front-end needs to process?
	How to develop a maintainable and extendable parser for MC?
	How to apply a type-system to MC?
The project comes with the following requirements:

\subsection{Adaptability requirement}
The code created during this project should be easily maintainable by developers who did not initially design the structure of the compiler.

\subsection{Correctness requirement}
The program is a compiler and has an even smaller margin for bugs than other programs have. 
No program the compiler compiles would be bug-free if the compiler itself is not bug-free.

\subsection{Diagnostic requirement}
The front-end and type checker need to be able to give descriptive error information for the programmer of MC.
