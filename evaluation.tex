\section{Evaluation}
In this chapter we will look at the competence requirements associated with computer science according to the Rotterdam University of applied sciences.

\subsection{Administering}


\subsection{Analyzing}
During this project I often communicated with the stakeholders when new features were required in either the programming language or the compiler itself. When these new features needed to be added I prioritized them on importance and time required to implement. The importance of a feature I gathered from the stakeholders by looking at what they wanted that feature for.

\subsection{Advising}
I left documentation that described the plans I have for the future of this project so that the next research team can continue. Furthermore, in the code I left comments explaining the code and giving advise on how to expand on it. 

\subsection{Designing}
I designed a front-end and type checker that would outlast my stay at this project. The type checker communicates with the back-end through a well defined interface that I helped develop and debug.
